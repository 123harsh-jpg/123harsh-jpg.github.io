<font color="white">a</font>Committees are the backbone of strong<aa> volunteer organizations.
 The effective use of volunteers in with         staff brings about needed programs.
 When committees understand their role,  have a clearly defined direction, an  enabling staff,
 and organized and experienced leadership, there are no limits to their effectiveness.
There are eight steps in accomplishing a successful subunit committee structure. The eight 
steps are:
 1. Analyzing the Subunit's Needs 
 2. Writing Committee Guidelines
 3. Committee Member Assignments 
 4. Recruiting the Right People 
 5. Planning/Accountability 
 6. Monitoring Accomplishments
 7. Evaluations
 8. Recognition 
 We've provided short narratives    describing each step in the following section. 
There are many forms included to assist your subunit in beginning the process 
of developing strong committees. 

Organising can be defined as a process that initiates implementation of plans
 by clarifying jobs, working relationships and effectively deploying resources
 for attainment of identified and desired results (goals).
Therefore, it is a process which coordinates human efforts, assembles resources
 and integrates both into a unified whole to be utilized for achieving specified 
objectives. Organizing is the managerial function and this function of organizing
 is known as process of organization.
To organize is to harmonize, co-ordinate or arrange in a logical and orderly manner.
